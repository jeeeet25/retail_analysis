Invoice Processing Pipeline on Azure
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end invoice processing pipeline built on Azure cloud services, designed to automate ingestion, transformation, and reporting of financial invoice data.

The pipeline uses Power Automate, SharePoint, Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2), Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI to build a robust ETL/ELT architecture with Bronze–Silver–Gold layers, real-time triggers, and business-ready dashboards.

🎯 Business Problem

Finance and procurement teams often face challenges in managing vendor invoices:

Manual processing is slow and error-prone.

Invoices arrive in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, Excel).

Lack of central visibility on vendor spend, overdue payments, and SLAs.

This pipeline automates the end-to-end lifecycle: from receiving invoices in email to delivering validated, aggregated, and analytics-ready data for decision-making.

🔹 End-to-End Data Flow

Invoice Arrival (Source)

Vendors send invoices via email.

Power Automate monitors Outlook → saves attachments to SharePoint.

Staging in SharePoint

Invoices centralized in an Incoming Invoices folder.

Optional: consolidate multiple attachments into a single batch file.

Raw Zone – ADLS Gen2

Power Automate/Event Grid copies new files to ADLS Gen2 Raw container.

Metadata (file name, size, source, timestamp) logged into Azure SQL/Log Analytics.

Cleansing & Structuring – Silver Zone

Azure Data Factory / Databricks Autoloader parses files.

Schema normalization (invoice_id, vendor_id, amount, due_date, etc.).

Deduplication, error handling, and validation.

Cleansed data stored in Parquet/Delta format in Silver zone.

Business Transformations – Gold Zone

Aggregations: monthly spend, vendor totals, payment aging.

Joins with vendor master data from SQL/ERP.

Outputs business-ready datasets in Gold zone + Synapse SQL Pool.

Analytics & Reporting

Power BI dashboards for Finance & Procurement:

Spend analysis

On-time vs overdue payments

Forecast trends

Automation & Monitoring

Event Grid triggers pipelines on file arrival.

Logic Apps / Power Automate send alerts for failed loads or SLA breaches.

Azure Monitor + Log Analytics track pipeline health & performance.

Optional Add-Ons

OCR with Form Recognizer → parse unstructured PDF invoices.

Purview for data catalog & lineage tracking.

Key Vault for secrets management.

Databricks ML for predicting late payments.
